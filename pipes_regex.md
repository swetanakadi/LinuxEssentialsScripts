# Instructions
### Case Scenario
A staff member has requested a list of the names of the 
services recognized by the current Linux image. A file 
named /etc/services has been located that contains the 
pertinent information; however it is not organized to 
easily determine all of the services.

* Using a combination of pipes, redirects and control 
statements, produce output that contains only the 
service names. 
* The entire task must be accomplished 
without using any intermediary files. 
* Each service 
should only be listed once and captured to a file named 
uniqueservices.txt, located in the home directory. 
Remove any blank lines or lines that are deemed to be 
comments.

### Objectives
* Extract all the service names from the file. 
* Sort the names alphabetically removing any duplicates. 
* Remove any blank lines or lines that do not begin with a letter of the alphabet. 
* Capture the final output to a file named uniqueservices.txt. 
* Count the lines in the file using a conditional command that is only executed if the previous combined commands are successful.
